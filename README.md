# DSCI 532: Group 215 - ParticulatesMatter

Members: Tejas Phaterpekar, Karlos Muradyan, Jarome Leslie

Dataset: Time series of particulate matter concentrations across BC


## Description

In our app, we plan to have four plots that give different insights into the air pollution situation in the Greater Vancouver area. One time-series plot will track pollutant concentration over time, across multiple different locations. The second time-series plot will be similar to the first, except it will feature only one location (selected by the user) and will show the trend of both types of pollutants over time. We will also have a heatmap that highlights all locations in the study to allow the user to compare pollutant concentrations by intensity. The heatmap will be equipped with a tooltip that informs the user of exact pollutant values when they hove over different areas of the plot. Finally, we will have a histogram that will contain the distributions of pollutants for multiple locations. The interactivity of the four graphs will focus on giving the user flexibility in which locations and pollutant types they want to analyze. Changes in the plot, with respect to what data is being displayed, will depend on what filters the user selects from dropdown menus and checkbox features. Furthermore, a range slider is provided to give users global control over what time range is being observed across all four plots. Finally, the interactive controls have been color coded to connect the interactive components to their corresponding graph.
